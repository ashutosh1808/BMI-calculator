# BMI-calculator
Hello friends! This is my next project, ie "BMI calculator". The front end is done by Python, with tkinter for GUI and the back end is done using MySQL. In this application, we have options to calculate BMI, to check history and to export the data in an Excel sheet

BMI is basically Body Mass Index, which lets us know that if we're normal, skinny or overweight. If the BMI is less than or equal to 24.9, it means the user lies in the normal zone. Else, if the BMI is less than 29.9 but more than 24.9 it means the user is fat, or if more than 29.9 then the user is obese.
